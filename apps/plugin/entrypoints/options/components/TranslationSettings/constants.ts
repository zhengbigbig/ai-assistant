  ORIGINAL: 'Some people spend their entire lives pursuing what others are born with. And when life comes to an end, perhaps those who pursued relentlessly finally attain what they desired, while those who were born with it may have lost their only possession.',
  TRANSLATED:
    '有些人毕生所追求的东西往往是另一些人与生就俱来的东西。而当人生将走到尽头时, 也许毕生追求的人得到了所渴望的,而与生俱来的人却失去了他们仅有的。',
